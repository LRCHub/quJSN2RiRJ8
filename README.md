[00:00.08] Darling, darling, darling, darling
[00:04.58] Why did you shoot yourself in the foot again?
[00:27.08] 
[00:08.86] Darling, darling, darling, darling
[00:11.27] I shot myself in the foot again
[00:13.96] (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
[00:17.62] Drumming, drumming, drumming, drumming
[00:19.52] Rrrpa, fell through the roof again
[00:23.25] What a day, what a day
[00:34.25] 
[00:25.74] I'm bothered by my illusions of nightmares of werewolves
[00:31.98] What a day, what a day
[00:33.95] I'm cornered by your delusion that I might be an angel
[00:40.79] Where are your wings? Where are the wings?
[01:01.79] 
[00:42.42] I'm mister, mister, mister
[00:46.28] I'm Mr. Insanity
[00:50.73] I'm sorry I messed up
[00:53.38] Messed up, messed up
[00:54.95] I prayed for your sanity
[01:06.95] 
[01:01.13] Darling, darling, darling, darling
[01:03.57] The walls are turning red again
[01:06.17] (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
[01:09.86] Bawling, bawling, bawling, bawling
[01:12.56] My tears are on the roof again
[01:15.66] What a day, what a day
[01:26.66] 
[01:17.65] I'm bothered by my illusions of nightmares of werewolves
[01:23.96] What a day, what a day
[01:26.42] I'm cornered by your delusion that I might be an angel
[01:32.69] Where are your wings? Where are the wings?
[01:53.69] 
[01:35.13] I'm mister, mister, mister
[01:38.55] I'm Mr. Insanity
[01:43.14] I'm sorry I messed up
[01:45.88] Messed up, messed up
[01:47.23] I prayed for your sanity
[01:51.42] Hey!
[01:53.42] 
[01:51.94] Do you see the stars?
[01:54.10] Do you see the lights?
[01:56.28] Pouring out my eyes
[01:58.37] They're pouring out your lies
[02:00.62] Do you see the stars?
[02:02.93] Do you see the lights?
[02:04.82] Pouring out my eyes
[02:07.11] They're pouring out your lies
[02:21.61] 
[02:09.40] Oh, I'm mister, mister, mister
[02:13.42] I'm Mr. Insanity
[02:17.94] I'm sorry I messed up
[02:20.67] Messed up, messed up
[02:22.55] I prayed for your sanity
[02:34.55] 
[02:27.82] Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
[02:32.12] Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
[02:35.88] Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
[02:40.39] Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
